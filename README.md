This is a simple script to extend GMail functionality with a label named "tomorrow".

Where I move a thread (it's a GMail conversation) to "tomorrow", the day after the thread is moved again to my inbox and marked as unread.

Google Apps Script (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) is the technology used.

Usage:

- I create an Excel doc on Google Drive

- I paste the script in this repository into the script editor in Tools->Script Editor and save.

- Then I trigger a daily execution (from 24:00 to 1:00) of the daily function of my script.
